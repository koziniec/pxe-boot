## EVE Initial configuration
[initial.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/eve/initial.zip %})<br>

This is the file that you should download and work with to complete the lab.<BR> 
**DO NOT UNZIP** the file.  EVE imports the zip files in their compressed format.

## EVE Final configuration
[final.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/eve/final.zip %})<br>

This configuration file above is as it should appear after completing all the steps in the lab.  You only need to use this file for one of the following reasons:

- You really don't understand what the lab requires, and you want to look at the final configuration to reverse engineer what the lab was asking you to do.
- You finished the lab, but it doesn't behave as expected, and after trying everything, you still can't figure out what is wrong.  Comparing the final configuration to your configuration and looking at the differences may help you close in on the issue.

Keep in mind that a final configuration is not always provided and where it is provided, the author may not have thoroughly checked it.  These configurations are often quickly put together to review the lab sequencing and commands and sometimes edits to the lab documentation occur that means the final configuration no longer perfectly matches the lab.  Essentially this file is a test of the documentation, not an artifact really intended as a teaching aid.  Nevertheless, many have requested that I make them available.

If there are significant errors in the Final Configuration, let the author know, and I will fix them as and when I can. If nothing else. I can make a post in the News to highlight the issue.
